Go Experiments
==============

A small repository of code that contains my learning-experiments using the golang language/libraries.

Highlights include:

* 2fa
    * Two-factor support using TOTP
* sub-command
    * Writing binaries that allow subcommands.
* local-ip
    * Getting the local IP address of your system.
* cidr-match
    * Testing if IPs are within ranges
* hash-ids
    * Test the hashing-library I use for generating "shortlinks"
* publishr
    * File upload/publishing server.
