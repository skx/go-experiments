Go Experiments
==============

A small repository of code that contains my learning-experiments using the golang language/libraries.

Highlights include:

* 2fa
    * Authentication using TOTP.
    * This is usually used to add two-factor support, in addition to username/password.
* sub-command
    * Writing binaries that allow subcommands.
* local-ip
    * Getting the local IP address of your system.
* cidr-match
    * Testing if IPs are within ranges.
* hash-ids
    * Test the hashing-library I use for generating "shortlinks".
* publishr
    * File upload/publishing server, [documented on my blog](http://blog.steve.org.uk/all_about_sharing_files_easily.html)
* infod
    * File introspection and meta-data sharing.
