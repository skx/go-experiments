Simple Files Server
-------------------


This program allows files to be uploaded, via HTTP-POST, and
later read back. It can be used to store files on the move.

You can upload a file like so:

    curl --header X-Auth:1.2.3.4 -X POST -F "file=@/etc/motd" http://localhost:8081/upload

Then get it back again like so:

    curl -v http://localhost:8081/get/vO

(The upload will give you the name to fetch.)


Authentication
--------------

Uploads are protected by the "X-Auth" header, which contains a TOTP
value based upon a shared secret.

To generate the secret for the server, and view it:

     publishr init
     publishr secret
